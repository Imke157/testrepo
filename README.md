# testrepo Introduction

This is an evaluation project on Animal health surveillance of the Netherlands. 
The dataset contains information on the number of times veterinary practices called to an organisation 
to get information on animal health. The information can be case specific or more general. Due to privacy, the data is anomynized.

The provided data is a selection of the real available data. This is the part of the data needed to run the script. 
The script contains first the data editing followed by the unfinished data analysis. The aim of the analysis was to determine if 
larger veterinary practices, those with many relations, do have less contact with the organization as was hypothesised. 
Large veterianry practices were assumed to have more knowledge and will therefore take less contact, with the risk that signals on
animal diseased are missed by the surveillance program. The consequence can be that animal disease is detected to late. 

# Packages
Packages needed for this script are dplyr, lme4 and optimx
